# Source Data
This folder holds source data for residential home prices. This data was manually sourced from a compilation of online websites (e.g. Redfin, Zillow, etc.) 

It seems like it is not easy to obtain such data at scale for free: https://www.city-data.com/forum/salt-lake-city-area/1531999-data-sales-history-slc-homes.html.

For the purposes of this demo, this small data collection should be sufficient!
